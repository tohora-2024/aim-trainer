# Aim Trainer

Welcome to Aim Trainer, the ultimate tool crafted by a group of students for gamers to be able to enhance their clicking speed and precision! 

Aim Trainer was born from a shared vision and is tailored specifically to help you improve your gaming skills through a variety of engaging game modes. Whether you are warming up before a big game or just looking to improve your mouse handling skills, Aim Trainer is the perfect solution for you! 

## Our Team
We started Aim Trainer as a project not only to challenge ourselves for our final group projects, but to create something fun and light-hearted that would allow people of all ages to play. Our team, consisting of fellow gamers and budding software developers, noticed a common hurdle amongst players; how can mouse dexterity and reaction time be improved?
